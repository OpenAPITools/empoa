//tag::description[]
== Description
link:http://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api[Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI] is a standardisation effort around OpenAPI.
In particular, it offers an API to model OpenAPI specification (interfaces in the `org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models` package and sub-packages).

This repository contains different projects (implementations and utilities) for this API.
Providing a complete vendor implementation for the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI is out-of-scope.
